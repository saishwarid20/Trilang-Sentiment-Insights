# Trilang-Sentiment-Insights
An advanced sentiment analysis tool designed to analyze and process text data in three languages simultaneouslyâ€”English, Hindi and Marathi. This project utlilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) from user-generated content across different platforms, such as social media, customer reviews, and online forums. This offers a comprehensive understanding of sentiments across different linguistic audiences.
This can aslo detect the languages using one of the python libraries and then process to decode the snetiments. This works not only for text but also for image based texts. 
Texts is detected from the images and then the text is being processed to find out the sentiments. 
I have added a User Interface such that user can also test it or find out the snetiments hidden in the text or images.
